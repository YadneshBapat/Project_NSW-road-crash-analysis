##  Project Background: 
<p align="justify"> 
Road accidents are the primary cause of injuries and fatalities globally. Road accidents claim millions of lives each year and leave countless more injured. About 8.2 million people live in New South Wales (NSW), the most populated state in Australia. It makes up to 33% of the nation's total population as of 2023. Ensuring safe travel has been a top concern for legislators, law enforcement, and urban planners because of the continuous expansion of the population and development of infrastructure. This project uses a publicly released dataset by NSW to identify important patterns and insights that might help lower accident rates and increase road safety. </p>

#### Insights and recommendations are provided on the following areas:
<li>Overview of road collisions</li>
<li>Recommendations for every region</li>
<li>Crash location wise recommendations </li>

## Project Objectives:
<p align="justify"> The project's main goal is to conduct a thorough analysis of road collision incidents in New South Wales between 2016 and 2023 to produce useful information that can lower accident rates and enhance road safety. The frequency, location, and severity of collisions, as well as environmental factors including weather, illumination, road surface, and urban vs rural settings, will all be examined in this research. Finding collision hotspots in certain communities, streets, or junctions where accidents happen frequently and determining if characteristics like road design, alignment, or inadequate street lighting contribute to these trends are important components of this research. At the end, a comprehensive picture of the causes that lead to traffic accidents in New South Wales is presented by integrating geographic, environmental, behavioural, and infrastructure aspects will be presented. Finally, data-supported suggestions will be provided which can be used by safety professionals, traffic authorities, and policymakers to make NSW roads safer for all users.

## Data source:
Data obtained from the NSW Government [(Transport Open Data portal)](https://opendata.transport.nsw.gov.au/dataset/nsw-crash-data)

## Dataset structure:
<p align="justify">
The dataset used in this project is organized into a relational database schema designed to capture detailed information about road crashes and the associated traffic units involved in each incident.  </p> <br>

<li>Overall road collision analysis:</li>
<ul>
  <li> The Number of road collisions has reduced gradually from 2016 till 2021 however, it rises steadily from 2021 to 2023. </li>

  <li> A Similar trend can be seen for minor, major, and serious injuries and several individuals were killed. The number of individuals killed jumped by 21% from 2022 to 2023.</li><li>
  A higher average number of crashes per day occurred on weekends during several late-night and midday intervals, particularly between 12:00 PM–2:00 PM and midnight–2:00 AM.
Weekday crashes dominated during morning commute hours (6:00 AM–10:00 AM) and late afternoon (4:00 PM–6:00 PM), aligning with typical workday traffic patterns.
Overall, more 2-hour intervals showed a weekend trend in crash density, though weekdays were consistently high during peak traffic times.
These trends highlight potential risk periods for targeted road safety interventions depending on the day of the week and time of day.</li>
<li> Based on the crash data, Fridays recorded the highest number of crashes, followed closely by Thursdays and Wednesdays, indicating that the latter part of the workweek sees the most incidents. Saturdays also had a high number of crashes, surpassing most weekdays except Friday, suggesting increased weekend activity. Tuesdays and Mondays had slightly lower counts, while Sundays consistently saw the fewest crashes, potentially due to reduced travel and work-related traffic. This pattern highlights a clear spike in crashes toward the end of the workweek and into the weekend. </li>
<li> The crash data from 2016 to 2023 reveals that Greater Sydney has the highest crash count (69,281) due to its large population and numerous local areas. The Far West & Remote region follows with 45,019 crashes, driven by its expansive geography and sparsely populated areas. North Coast & Hunter reports 30,819 crashes, reflecting a combination of urban centers and popular tourist destinations. The South Coast & ACT Region and Central West & Tablelands have fewer crashes, at 10,666 and 8,646. Respectively, due to their lower population densities and fewer regions. These patterns emphasize how population size and geographic spread influence crash totals across different areas. </li>
