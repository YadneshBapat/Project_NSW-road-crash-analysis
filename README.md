# Project_NSW-road-crash-analysis

### Background & overview:
Around 33% of Australia's total population lives in New South Wales, and thousands of individuals get their driver's licenses each year. Traffic collisions result in human, social, and economic costs every year. Road safety is a critical concern in the state. A comprehensive analysis of crash frequencies, hotspot locations, environmental conditions affecting the crash, and injury severity will help in addressing the issue.

This project aims to transform raw data into actionable insights, which will help in creating new road safety initiatives and road policies.
