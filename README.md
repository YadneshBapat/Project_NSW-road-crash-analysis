# Project_NSW-road-crash-analysis

### Background & overview
Around 33% of Australia's total population lives in New South Wales, and thousands of individuals get their driver's licenses each year. Traffic collisions result in human, social, and economic costs every year. Road safety is a critical concern in the state. A comprehensive analysis of road collision data will help in addressing the issue. This project aims to analyse crash frequencies, hotspot locations, environmental conditions affecting the crash, injury severity, and provide recommendations that will help reduce the number of crashes.
