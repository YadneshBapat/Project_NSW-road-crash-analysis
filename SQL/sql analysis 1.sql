/* 
Project: NSW road collision analysis for 2015 - 2023

Aim of the project: The aim of this project is to analyze historical road crash and injury data to identify factors such as speed limits, weather conditions, and location type 
that influence road crashes. To detect anomalies, such as specific conditions or locations where crash rates are disproportionately high, to identify potential safety risks. 
Generating reports based on the ingishts to recommend strategies for minimizing future road crashes.
